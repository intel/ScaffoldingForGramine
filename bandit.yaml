  # We have duly considered possible security implications of importing
  # subprocess and concluded that there are in fact no implications in this
  # project.
  # We treat security very seriously.

  # Yeah, we run commands with subprocess, so what.

  # https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/b607_start_process_with_partial_path.html
  # We use docker and is-sgx-avaliable as provided by external packages. We rely
  # on properly configured $PATH for that, which is perfectly normal.

  # https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/b701_jinja2_autoescape_false.html
  # Jinja's autoescape is specific to HTML, and we mostly render Dockerfiles and
  # other configs, so having autoescape is at best useless, and at worst adds
  # cognitive load to developers who would have keep in mind which templates are
  # autoescaped and which aren't.
